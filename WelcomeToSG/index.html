<article>Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles.  It achieved self-rule from the British
   colonial masters in 1959, joined Malaysia in 1963, left in 9 August 1965, and became a roaring
   tiger economy in the 1980s.  It was only from 1990 onwards that Singapore attached priority into 
   research and development.  The computer industry for example, is now a rising industry.  I would like
   the authorities to give time to programming in schools, by teaching either JavaScript or Python 3.
   <br><br>
   As for personal professional development.  I am interested in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MySQL, Java, 
   Bootstrap, Java Spring Framework, Python 3, Ruby with Rails, Perl 5, MongoDB (NoSQL), ELisp, Racket,
   and Erlang.

   Here are some of the places that Singapore's IT/Computing industry are relying on:
